# wave-function-python
A **wave function collapse** simulation/visualizer written in **python**.
Instead of using rules the blocks compare the edges of all possible tiles to make sure that they match.

The end result is visualized through **pygame**.

If you are using this application remember to:
```
    pip install pygame
```

You can run the application with the command:
```
    python3 main.py

You have to be in the root directory **root directory** of the application for the command to work.
