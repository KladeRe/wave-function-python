# wave-function-python
A **wave function collapse** simulation written in **python**
Instead of using rules the blocks compare the edges of all possible tiles to make sure that they match

The end result is visualized through **pygame**

If you are using this application remember to
```
    pip install pygame
```
You can run the application with the command:
```
    python3 main.py
```
or
```
    python main.py
```
while you are in the **root directory** of the application.
